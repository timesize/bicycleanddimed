Guy honking and insisting for me to get off of the designated bike lane that not every street even has.

Told him I am literally exactly where I'm supposed to be as we stopped at the same sign.

We were on a street with a yellow dotted line but he thought that I should get completely off of my lane instead of him just passing.
