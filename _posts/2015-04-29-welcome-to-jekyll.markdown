Today I delivered to a posh? building in uptown Oakland, with an awkwardly positioned intercom. I lament encountering those things. They feel like ancestors to LED watches, side by side with the mobile device that makes this platform possible.

The box, of course, did not work as planned and as an occupant approached I struggled to stay out of the way as she oddly needed to tag the side of the speaker-box perpendicular to her doorway in order to enter. I then spun the other way to allow a another women through. This apparently didn't leave the normal amount of room for her husband to open the door from the angle he's accustomed to. He abruptly suggested I, "Let [him] around 'dude'."

I didn't remind him I'm a human even though I'm working, and not for him I'd add, because his wife was pushing a stroller. For a moment I assumed I had blocked her way. Quite pleasantly I was surprised by the woman offering a "please" as the word he was looking for.

This altercation likely came about because I made the fatal mistake of mentioning the service I work for instead of merely using my name at the door. I am clearly not an associate of a neighbor, and so ought to tap dance around occupants as I magically appear at and apartment door without seating foot in the hall.
