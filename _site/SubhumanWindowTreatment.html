      <p>Today I delivered to a posh? building in uptown Oakland, with an awkwardly positioned intercom. I lament encountering those things. They feel like ancestors to LED watches, side by side with the mobile device that makes this platform possible.</p>

<p>The box, of course, did not work as planned and as an occupant approached I struggled to stay out of the way as she oddly needed to tag the side of the speaker-box perpendicular to her doorway in order to enter. I then spun the other way to allow a another women through. This apparently didn’t leave the normal amount of room for her husband to open the door from the angle he’s accustomed to. He abruptly suggested I, “Let [him] around ‘dude’.”</p>

<p>I didn’t remind him I’m a human even though I’m working, and not for him I’d add, because his wife was pushing a stroller. For a moment I assumed I had blocked her way. Quite pleasantly I was surprised by the woman offering a “please” as the word he was looking for.</p>

<p>This altercation likely came about because I made the fatal mistake of mentioning the service I work for instead of merely using my name at the door. I am clearly not an associate of a neighbor, and so ought to tap dance around occupants as I magically appear at and apartment door without seating foot in the hall.</p>
